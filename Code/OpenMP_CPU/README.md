This directory contains exercises and solutions for a hands-on
OpenMP course.  Information about these programs can be found
in the comments and in the slides from the course.

To use these programs, modify the makefile so it references the 
OpenMP enabled compiler you want to use.  Then test that everything 
works:

   make test

We have tested these programs under Linux and OSX with the gnu and 
Intel compilers.
