# SciCompHPC

This repository holds materials for a course on HPC in Scientific Computing. When solving scienific problems, you often encounter performance limitations that limit what you can do.  Hence, there is an almost ubiquitous need for HPC (High Performance Computing) in the sciences.

What is High Performance Computing? It is an approach to computing where software is designed around the features of a computing system so you can: (1) run fixed sized problems in less time, or (2) run problems too large to fit into a single system.  HPC applications are written to get the most from laptops, execute on GPUs, and scale to run on large parallel systems.  It emcompasses heterogeneous computing where multiple computer architectures, such as GPUs and CPUs, are used in a single program. 

The programmer in Scientific computing must understand the science they are addressing, the math behind their  problems, and the features of the computer systems they will use.  This makes it challenging, but if you are a practicing scientist, you expect challenges.   As you will see as you work through the course, people have been working in HPC applied to the sciences for a long time.  There is always a great deal of new work that is needed, but we've been doing this long enough that we have a well established foundation of knowledge you can build on.  Learning that foundational knowlege is straightforward for any motivated scientist.
